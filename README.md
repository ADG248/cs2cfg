# Counter-Strike 2 Configuration File - CS2cfg

**Counter-Strike 2 Configuration File - autoexec.cfg**<br/>
This is a base template autoexec.cfg file for an easier setup from scratch.<br/>
Set the values for the commands you want to use. Most are just 0 and 1, some others like sensitivity, need a specific value.<br/>
>**⚠️Be aware that some values are already set for viewmodel, radar, audio, telemetry, and more. If you don’t want your settings to change, remove these first.**<br/>

### Place autoexec.cfg in \Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg
```
\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg
```
### Enter "+exec autoexec" in CS2's Launch Options
```
+exec autoexec
```

### Additional Notes
- Enter "exec autoexec" in the console, or just "autoexec" because of the alias, to apply changes made to the Config File in-game. You can also bind a key "bind *key* exec autoexec".<br/>
- Settings changed in-game will reset back to the Config File's value each time the file is loaded.<br/>
- This Config also includes "PracticeMode" On/Off Keybinds, Spawn CT/T Bot Keybinds, Delete Grenade Keybind (Delete Smokes, etc.), Set practice lineups for Instant Window smokes on Mirage, and more.<br/>
